Advances in digitalization offer new possibilities to address these challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Meta’s LLaMA 3.1, can play a key role in improving the quality and efficiency of services. This article explores the potential of LLM technology to enhance the experiences of both professionals and patients in social and healthcare services.</p><figure name="82c2" id="82c2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WymJZ8iRS1RtHADw0R5twQ.jpeg" data-width="1024" data-height="1024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WymJZ8iRS1RtHADw0R5twQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="4e6c" id="4e6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1. LLM as an Assistant for Healthcare Professionals</strong><br>Healthcare and social care professionals’ daily work is often heavily documentation-oriented. Patient records, notes, and care plans require significant documentation time, which reduces the time available for direct patient care. LLM technology can streamline this process by automatically generating patient notes, recommendations, and care instructions based on the information provided. This saves time and reduces administrative burden while ensuring that essential details are not overlooked.</p><p name="17d8" id="17d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Data Analysis and Decision Support</strong><br>LLM technology can process vast amounts of data, such as lab results, diagnoses, and patient history, providing accurate and well-supported recommendations to healthcare staff. This is especially helpful for general practitioners who may encounter more specialized problems, such as substance use disorders, where expertise is often fragmented. For example, LLM can learn from specialists and provide valuable information to general practitioners or other healthcare staff.</p><p name="1620" id="1620" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3. Multilingual Communication</strong><br>In large cities like Helsinki, over 150 languages are spoken, and the availability of interpreters is often limited. LLM can act as an efficient translation tool, facilitating communication between patients and professionals. This improves access to services for foreign-born patients, ensures understanding, and reduces misunderstandings that could affect the quality of care.</p><p name="1294" id="1294" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4. Enhancing Patient Autonomy and Empowerment</strong><br>LLM technology not only improves professionals’ workflows but also empowers patients. The right to self-determination and to receive care in one’s own language (785/1992), as well as the constitutional right to adequate social and healthcare services (731/1999), can be better realized with the help of LLMs. The technology could provide patients with recommendations and information in their own language and compile data from different sources into an easily understandable format.</p><p name="1156" id="1156" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5. Automatic Process Optimization and Updating Legacy Systems</strong><br>Social care systems like Effica and Apotti are known for their complexity and require extensive manual work, which slows down service delivery. LLM can help automate processes such as filling out forms and making simple decisions. This could reduce errors and speed up service delivery.</p><p name="7de1" id="7de1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">6. Apotti System Challenges and the Opportunities with LLM Technology</strong><br>The Apotti system is a massive project with a total investment of about one billion euros and operational costs of approximately 220,000 euros per month. Its goal was to replace numerous systems with a unified and comprehensive solution, but its implementation has faced significant criticism. Many healthcare workers find Apotti cumbersome and time-consuming, with issues like slow data entry, confusing interfaces, and constant clicking that distract from patient care. One user stated: “It feels like I’m managing the computer, not the patient.”</p><p name="484a" id="484a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although Apotti consolidates previously scattered systems, its usability still requires improvement. This raises the question: Could LLM technology address these issues more effectively and with smaller investments? LLM technology could offer a more flexible and scalable solution at a significantly lower cost. It is estimated that a well-developed and efficient LLM system could be built for a few million euros, without the massive ongoing costs associated with systems like Apotti.</p><figure name="cf30" id="cf30" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6P-adoaoOXiL35WC-jjmTA.png" data-width="1024" data-height="1024" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6P-adoaoOXiL35WC-jjmTA.png"></figure><p name="ebb5" id="ebb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">7. Security and Resource Needs for LLM Implementation</strong><br>Implementing LLM technology in social and healthcare services requires substantial investment in security. Since these systems handle sensitive patient data, LLM models must be implemented with the same security standards as patient record systems. This means allocating server resources and utilizing language models like Meta’s LLaMA 3.1. LLaMA 3.1 offers the potential for a multilingual and efficient LLM model, but its implementation requires significant computational power and infrastructure.</p><p name="92bc" id="92bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Welfare districts should ensure that LLM operates within their own networks, isolated from public networks and protected from external threats. The computational power requirements may be substantial, as models like Meta’s LLaMA 3.1 need large server resources and fast data transfer to function in real time and effectively.</p><p name="9dee" id="9dee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">8. Speech Recognition and Structured Documentation with LLM Technology</strong><br>Currently, many doctors, nurses, and social workers find that documentation takes too much time and is overly complex, as evidenced by feedback from the Apotti system. LLM can change this by allowing professionals to dictate patient or client information verbally, which the LLM then converts into structured documentation. This solution not only speeds up the documentation process but also reduces the need for manual writing, allowing professionals to focus more on interacting with patients or clients.</p><p name="543a" id="543a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">9. Structured Documentation with LLM Technology</strong><br>The shift toward structured documentation in healthcare and social services is already underway, where patient and client data are recorded using agreed-upon structures. In healthcare, patient records must be completed promptly, within five days of the event, and in social care, client data must be recorded immediately after the case is processed. Structured entries make information easier to retrieve and utilize, such as when creating summaries or statements.</p><p name="5e7c" id="5e7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LLM technology can further accelerate and simplify this transition. Professionals can use speech recognition to dictate information, which the LLM automatically converts into structured data. This significantly reduces the need for manual documentation and speeds up data entry, freeing up time for direct patient and client care. LLM can also utilize predefined codes and classifications, ensuring that documentation is consistent and standardized across the entire service system.</p><p name="1665" id="1665" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">10. LLM Technology to Assist Client Communication</strong><br>The rapid digitalization of social and healthcare services has left many clients, particularly older adults and those in vulnerable situations, unable to use computers or electronic services. LLM technology could assist in these cases by automatically contacting clients via phone. AI could call clients, collect necessary information, or provide instructions for handling their cases.</p><p name="4189" id="4189" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This service would be especially helpful for those who cannot use electronic systems or face language barriers. Automating phone calls would also reduce the need for manual customer service, allowing professionals to focus on more demanding tasks.</p></div></div></section><section name="3b7e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="eea9" id="eea9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">References</strong></p><ol class="postList"><li name="c932" id="c932" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Feedback on the Apotti system: <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Apotti tuli taloon — Tehyläiset kertovat, mitä mieltä he ovat uudesta massiivisesta työvälineestään</em>, Tehy Magazine.</li><li name="d205" id="d205" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Structured documentation in healthcare and social services: <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">THL’s guidelines on information management</em>, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).</li><li name="a261" id="a261" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">LLaMA 3.1 and security requirements: <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Meta LLaMA documentation</em>, Meta AI.</li></ol></div></div></section>
